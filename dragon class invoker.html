      <h1>Invoker dragons</h1>
      <p>Here is a breakdown of the defining features of the <strong>Invoker class</strong>:</p>  

      <h3><strong> In War Dragons, the Invoker class refers to a specific type of dragon with distinct abilities</strong></h3> 
      <h3>In War Dragons, Invoker dragons are a unique class that combines elements of Hunter and Sorcerer dragons,<br> offering a distinctive playstyle and strategic depth. Their primary feature is a four-shot attack sequence:</h3>
      <ol>
      <li><strong> Three Shots: Standard breath attacks.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Fourth Shot: An empowered attack with special effects, varying by dragon.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>After firing all four shots, the ammo regenerates simultaneously, requiring a brief recharge period before reuse.</strong></li> 
      </ol>
       <p>Invoker dragons typically possess a mix of offensive and defensive spells,<br> drawing from both Hunter and Sorcerer abilities. Their mid-range health <br> and strength make them versatile in various combat scenarios.</p> 
    
      <h3><strong>Distinct Abilities of Invoker Dragons:</strong></h3>
      <ol>
      <li><strong>Four-Shot Ammo System:</strong></li></ol>
      <p>Invokers have four ammo shots in their attack cycle:<br>
         The first three shots function as simple ranged attacks, <br> similar to a Hunter dragon's breath attacks but weaker individually.<br>
      The <strong>fourth shot</strong> is a special empowered attack, which may have additional effects like:<br>
         Dealing area-of-effect (AoE) damage.<br>
         Debuffing enemy towers.<br>
         Applying crowd control or disabling tower abilities.<br>
         After firing all four shots, the Invoker dragon must recharge its ammo, making timing and precision crucial.
         <ol>
      <li><h3><strong>Spell Mix:</strong></h3></li> </ol>
        <strong> Invokers </strong> often combine characteristics from other dragon classes:<br>
                 Hunter-like precision with strategic targeting.<br>
                 Sorcerer-like AoE spells or utility abilities.<br>
            They may have a combination of damage-dealing and defensive spells<br> such as shields or healing abilities, making them versatile<br> for both offense and survival.<br>
  <ol>
      <li><h3><strong>Balanced Strength:</strong></h3></li></ol>
        <strong>Health & Durability:</strong> Invokers typically have a moderate amount of health,<br> somewhere between the high health of Warrior dragons and<br> the low health of Hunters.<br>
                 They are less tanky than Warriors but can sustain<br> themselves longer than Hunters with careful play.<br>
        <h3>Examples of Invoker Dragons and Their Unique Abilities:</h3>
        <h4>Namaka (the first Invoker released):</h4>
      <strong>Fourth shot </strong> triggers a wave of destruction that damages all towers in its path.<br>
                  Spells include a reflective shield to block attacks and regenerate health.<br>
      <strong> Zilch</strong><br>
            Fourth shot deals AoE damage to multiple towers.<br>
            Includes spells that disable and weaken enemy defenses.<br>
      <h3>Strategic Play Tips:</h3>
      <strong>Ammo Management:</strong> Carefully time the use of the fourth shot<br> for maximum damage and control.<br>
      <strong>Spell Synergy:</strong> Combine spells with the fourth shot<br> to maximize its effects, such as stunning <br>towers before delivering the empowered attack.<br>
      <strong>Precision</strong> Like Hunter dragons, Invokers benefit from strategic<br> targeting and timing rather than brute force.<br>
      <h4>In summary, Invokers offer a tactical gameplay style that blends offense, <br>strategy, and utility. Their distinct ability to unleash a powerful<br> fourth attack and recharge all at once adds a new dimension to combat strategy in War Dragons.</h4>
