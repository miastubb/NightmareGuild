<p>Here is a breakdown of the defining features of the <strong>sorcerer dragon</strong></p>

<strong> War Dragons, the Sorcerer class refers to a specific type of dragon with distinct abilities...</strong>
    <!-- Add more content here -->

<strong>Sorcerer dragons</strong> in War Dragons have several key<br> characteristics that define their playstyle and abilities:
<h3>1. Attack Style:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong> sorcerer dragons</strong> use a swipe attack<br> that targets up to three towers simultaneously.<br>
    Their attacks deal less damage per hit compared to the single-target,<br> focused attacks of Hunter dragons.</li>
<li><h3><strong>2. Spell-Centric Gameplay:</strong></h3>
<li>Sorcerers are highly reliant on spells, often equipped with a powerful arsenal.<br>
    Spells can include damage-dealing abilities <br>(like Fireball), defensive spells (like Shield), or utility spells (like Rage generation or tower disabling).<br>
    Effective spell use is critical for success, as their primary attack alone<br> is not sufficient for heavy damage output.
<h3><strong>3. Rage Dependency:</strong></h3>
<li>Sorcerers require substantial Rage to maximize their potential,<br> as their spells are their main source of power.<br>
    Rage management is crucial to keep casting spells during prolonged battles.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>4. Durability:</strong></h3>  
<ol>  
<li>They typically have moderate health, balancing between the high durability<br> of Warrior dragons and the low health of Hunters.<br>
    Their durability allows them to withstand more damage than Hunters<br> but requires careful planning against heavy defenses.
<h3><strong>5. Strategic Role:</strong></h3>
<li>Sorcerers are best suited for players who can strategically manage spells<br> and plan their attacks to exploit weaknesses in enemy defenses.<br>
    They excel at clearing multiple towers when spells are used effectively.
<h3><strong>6. Strengths and Weaknesses:</strong></h3>
<li>Strengths: Wide coverage with attacks,<br> strong spell effects, good crowd control.<br>
    Weaknesses: Lower damage from primary attacks, <br>heavily reliant on Rage and spell management.</li>
</ol>
